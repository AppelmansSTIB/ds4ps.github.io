## The Learning Curve

(audience: graduate student wants to self-learn or prof that wants reference for new students)

* The Learning Curve (diagram and benchmarks) - how to get started
* The DS Ecosystem
* Data Programming
  * Which languages are popular
  * Explain how packages make R and Python flexible
  * R vs IDE (R Studio) vs Markdown
  * Advanced: some technical details about object-oriented, interpretted languages
* Markdown
* Data-Driven Docs
* Data formats and import options
* APIs (in general, finding interesting data, scraping, enriching, etc)
* Collaboration (GitHub, StackOverflow)
* Websites in GitHub
* Tools (packages), and a couple examples (gender package?)
* Join Us!  → ways to explore the field, get started

-------  

learning data science from a humanities and social science perspective
Why it matters (case studies?) - Return on Investment (how to measure this)
Data science toolkit example
ROI - time to development, cost to develop
Being part of a dynamic community? GitHub, StackOverflow, etc.


The learning curve ROADMAP (how long to develop skills, what to focus on)


Step 1: Understand why ecosystem is powerful? What is end goal? 
Open data / APIs
GitHub, collaboration tools
GitHub pages / R Websites


Step 2: Markdown? 
Example of asking questions on StackOverflow
Example of GitHub pages
Example of data-driven docs - just change output


Step 3: Learn a data programming language. Where to start???
How do you learn?
How long will it take? 
What are the stages? 


[ diagram of learning curve and benchmarks along the way ]
Where you are on learning curve
What knowledge you have at each stage
How do you get to the next step? 
How long each step takes? 
What support is available at each stage?

## Community

How can we create a user group for beginners? 
How do we make it accessible and welcoming? 
What is our audience? Social science and humanities. 
How to create examples that are both accessible and powerful? Tours of how cool projects are built, walk through one or more interesting steps. 

Activities / Resources: how to create opportunities to try on the data science hat 

Meet-up group for beginners
Trade-off between simplicity and effectiveness
“Vignettes” - cool case studies, guided tour of how a project works
What data was used?
What packages / tools? 
How did it come together? 
What problem was solved? Impact achieved? 
Events like weekly challenges (Tidy Tuesdays, Kaggle contests)
