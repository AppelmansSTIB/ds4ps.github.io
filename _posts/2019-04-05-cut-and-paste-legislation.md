In a ground-breaking investigative report, Rob O'Dell and USA Today have systematically tracked the [diffusion of cut-and-paste legislation](https://www.azcentral.com/pages/interactives/asbestos-sharia-law-model-bills-lobbyists-special-interests-influence-state-laws/) through state government. See:

"[How we uncovered 10,000 times lawmakers introduced copycat model bills â€” and why it matters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/03/how-laws-made-why-we-revealed-politicians-didnt-write-them/3162256002/)"

O'Dell and colleagues leveraged digital text available through LegiScan and insight from prior projects using data science tools to track the impact of special interest on the legislative process, such as [Legislative Influence Detector (LID)](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/lid/).
