In a ground-breaking investigative reporting, data journalist [Rob O'Dell](https://twitter.com/robodellaz) and USA Today have systematically tracked the [diffusion of cut-and-paste legislation](https://www.azcentral.com/pages/interactives/asbestos-sharia-law-model-bills-lobbyists-special-interests-influence-state-laws/) through state government. See:

O'Dell and colleagues leveraged digital text available through the LegiScan digital archives and insight from prior projects such as [Legislative Influence Detector (LID)](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/lid/). They data science tools to analyze the diffusion of pre-packaged laws through state system, thus creating a transparent data-driven process to track the impact of special interest on the legislative process.
