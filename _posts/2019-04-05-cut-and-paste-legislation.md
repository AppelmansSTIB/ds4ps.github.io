In a ground-breaking investigative report, Rob O'Dell and USA Today have systematically tracked the [diffusion of cut-and-paste legislation](https://www.azcentral.com/pages/interactives/asbestos-sharia-law-model-bills-lobbyists-special-interests-influence-state-laws/) through state government: "[How we uncovered 10,000 times lawmakers introduced copycat model bills â€” and why it matters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/03/how-laws-made-why-we-revealed-politicians-didnt-write-them/3162256002/)"
