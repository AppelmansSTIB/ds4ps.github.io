Data visualization became an essential skill for any professional in current digital era. Data scientists use multiple tools to visualize 
the results of own work, but some of them became extremely popular.

For R users [`ggplot2()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package became an iconic tool for making the data beautiful due to its special 
[**Grammar of Graphics**](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) (by L. Wilkinson) approach
and unique aestetics.

[Winston Chang](@winston_chang) released the 2nd edition of the [**R Graphics Cookbook**](https://r-graphics.org/index.html). 
According to the author, the book is _a practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs 
quickly, without having to comb through all the details of R’s graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a specific problem with a 
solution you can apply to your own project, and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe works._

_Each recipe in this book lists a problem and a solution. In most cases, the solutions I offer aren’t the only way to do things in R, 
but they are, in my opinion, the best way. One of the reasons for R’s popularity is that there are many available add-on packages, 
each of which provides some functionality for R. There are many packages for visualizing data in R, but this book primarily 
uses ggplot2_, highlighted the author.
