Grosser & Bumann have created a project to help hone data science skills through better programming. 

In 2014 the chief data sceintist of RStudio [**Hadley Wickham**](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) published his popular book [**Advanced R**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20), which was accompanied by a [web-site](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). 

According to Wickham, _the book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of Râ€™s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side._

The **second edition** of the book was [published](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0815384572/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hadlwick-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0815384572&linkId=9f8b9df5da858c12a5e9905aea66bf08) in 2019 (an online version is [available](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)).

**Malte Grosser** & **Henning Bumann** have made the text more accessible through a project called [**Advanced R Solutions**](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/), 
allowing readers to test their skills using exercises in the text.

Accoriding to authors, _it is work in progress and under active development_, but the companion textbook should be out in 2019. 

They have visualized progress in a cool chart:
