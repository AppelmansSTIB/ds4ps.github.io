Marley Walker has a great [blog post](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/electoral-maps-look-little-different-heres/) discussing the use of various cartograms to display geographic of populations of people when polygon size is not proportionate to the population they represent.

The Washington Post has a [nice story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/how-election-maps-lie/) explaining the nature of the problem. Walker does a good job of showing how various news outlets have come up with unique solutions.

There are several packages in R that allow you to create several types of cartograms. You might start with [**cartogram**](https://github.com/sjewo/cartogram),  eechidna[](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/eechidna/versions/1.3.0/topics/dorling), and [voteogram](https://rud.is/b/2017/05/07/plot-the-vote-making-u-s-senate-house-cartograms-in-r/).
