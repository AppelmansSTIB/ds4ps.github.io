In 2014 the chief data sceintist of RStudio [**Hadley Wickham**](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) published his famous book [**Advanced R**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20), which was accompanied with a [web-site](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). 

According to Wickham, _the book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of Râ€™s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side._

In 2019 the **second edition** of the book was [published](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0815384572/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hadlwick-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0815384572&linkId=9f8b9df5da858c12a5e9905aea66bf08) (online version is [available](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)).

Recently **Malte Grosser** & **Henning Bumann** published [**Advanced R Solutions**](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/), 
allowing readers to check themselves, working with the book exercises.

Accoriding to authors, _it is work in progress and under active development. The 2nd edition of Advanced R is still being revised, 
but we hope to provide most of the answers in 2019_.

The book also tracks the progress of solutions, visualizing them in a cool chart.
