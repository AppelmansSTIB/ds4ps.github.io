A wide variety of great resources can be found currently online for learning R and data science. More and more authors publish 
[books](https://bookdown.org/), using 
[`RMarkdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) and [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) packages. 

[Zach Bogart](https://twitter.com/zachbogart) and [Joyce Robbins](https://twitter.com/jtrnyc) presented their book 
[**edav.info/**](edav.info/), which is a _"curated collection of tools and references that will make it easier to learn 
how to work with data in R"._

According to its authors, _"this resource is specifically tailored to the GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization 
course offered at Columbia University"_, but will be helpful to anybody, who is interested in R. 

This reading offers the guidelines about the main chart types/tools plus introduces several walkthroughs where the authors
work with data and discuss problems as well as some tips/tricks that will help a reader.
