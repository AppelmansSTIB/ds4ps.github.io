Paula Moraga (https://paula-moraga.github.io/) presented her online book 
[**Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny**](https://paula-moraga.github.io/book-geospatial/index.html) 
(_under development_), 
which describes spatial and spatio-temporal statistical methods and visualization techniques to analyze georeferenced health data in R.

According to the author, _"this book is primarily aimed at epidemiologists, biostatisticians, public health specialists, 
and professionals of government agencies working with georeferenced health data. Moreover, since the methods discussed in 
the book are applicable not only to health data but also to many other fields that deal with georeferenced data, the book is 
also suitable for researchers and practitioners of other areas wishing to learn how to model and visualize this type of data 
such as epidemiology, ecology, demography or criminology"._

[@_PaulaMoraga_](https://twitter.com/_PaulaMoraga_) highlights that the book _"features detailed worked examples of several disease and environmental applications using real-world data such as 
malaria in The Gambia, cancer in Scotland and USA, and air pollution in Spain. Examples in the book focus on health applications, 
but the approaches covered are also applicable to other fields that use georeferenced data including epidemiology, ecology, 
demography or criminology"._
