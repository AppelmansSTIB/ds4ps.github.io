In a [recent blog](https://medium.com/@samedelstein/chief-data-officer-7bfc16b2401c) Sam Edelstein reflects on his time as the Chief Data Officer of the City of Syracuse:

> When I took the chief data officer job with the city, I thought I’d get to grab all the data and build predictive models which in turn would save millions of dollars, make people’s lives easier, and prevent issues like infrastructure failures. While I’ve gotten to do this a couple of times, on a day to day basis, the main goal is generally to figure out how to count stuff correctly.

I believe that his experience is symbolic of a lot of data science work in the public and nonprofit sectors. Every now and then there is an opportunity to create a cool predictive system, mobile app, or crowd-sourcing platform that generates notable impact. But most often data science professionals spend their time making incremental (but important!) improvements by building better databases, finding new ways to measure things, digitizing old files, "figuring out how to count stuff correctly", identifying trends, and nurturing communities of practice.
