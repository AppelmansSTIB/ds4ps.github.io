R is commonly known _as a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported 
by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing 
statistical software and data analysis_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))).

R offers a wide variety of [popular packages](https://awesome-r.com/), many of them are incredibly helpful for statistical analysis. 

[Solomon Kurz](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz) released a book [**Statistical Rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the 
tidyverse**](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access).

According to the author, _this project is an attempt to reexpress the code from the book_ 
[**Statistical Rethinking A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan (& PyMC3 & brms 
too)**](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by **R. McElreath**.

Kurz highlights that _models are re-fit with brms, 
the figures are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse 
style._
