Plotly is one of the most popular [R packages](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly) for creating interactive visualizations. 

Carson Sievert recently updated his book [**"Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny"**](https://plotly-r.com/).


> In this book, you’ll gain insight and practical skills for creating interactive and dynamic web graphics for data analysis from R. It makes heavy use of plotly for rendering graphics, but you’ll also learn about other R packages that augment a data science workflow, such as the tidyverse and shiny.

Plotly repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly).
