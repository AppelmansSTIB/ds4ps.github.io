On August 13, 2019 the Chief Data Scientist of RStudio [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) 
[announced](https://mastering-shiny.org/) that he was working on a new book project [**mastering shiny**](https://mastering-shiny.org).

According to the author, _"this is the online version of Mastering Shiny, a book currently under early development and intended 
for a late 2020 release by O’Reilly Media"._

Why is Shiny important for data scientists in public sector, working on analyzing and communicating their results?

As Wickham points out, "_[**Shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a framework for creating web applications using R code. 
It is designed primarily with data scientists in mind, and to that end, you can create pretty complicated Shiny apps 
with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. On the other hand, Shiny doesn’t limit you to creating trivial or 
prefabricated apps: its user interface components can be easily customized or extended, and its server uses 
reactive programming to let you create any type of backend logic you want. Shiny is designed to feel almost 
magically easy when you’re getting started, and yet the deeper you get into how it works, 
the more you realize it’s built out of general building blocks that have strong software engineering principles behind them._

_Today, Shiny is used in almost as many niches and industries as R itself is. 
It’s used in academia as a teaching tool for statistical concepts, a way to get undergrads excited about learning to write code, 
a splashy medium for showing off novel statistical methods or models. It’s used by big pharma companies to speed collaboration 
between scientists and analysts during drug development. It’s used by Silicon Valley tech companies to set up realtime metrics 
dashboards that incorporate advanced analytics."_
